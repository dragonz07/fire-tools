### 1. Sample Failure Progress

**Description**: This notebook is a basic demonstration of the `fire_notebook` SDK, showing how to:
- Output a string message during execution.
- Display progress percentage.
- Handle failure scenarios by providing a failure message.

**Key Features**:
- Example of `outStr()`.
- Progress tracking with `outputProgress()`.
- Failure message handling `outFailure()`.

### 3. Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis

**Description**: This notebook performs extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset. It includes visualizations created using the `outPlotly()` function from the `fire_notebook` SDK, and it demonstrates how to:
- Provide progress updates during execution with `outputProgress()`.
- Display running and success messages at the start and end of execution.

**Key Features**:
- EDA on customer churn data.
- Plotting with `outPlotly()`.
- Progress percentage updates and status messages.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, make sure you have the `fire_notebook` SDK installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/jupyter-docker/firenotebookwheel/fire_notebook-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

To import the SDK, use the following line:
```
from fire_notebook.output.workflowcontext import RestWorkflowContext
```
